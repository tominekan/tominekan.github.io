title: Hello, World
---
This is my first blog post. Since it is my first, it will contain `Hello world` in all the languages I know (with a bit of history).

**Python**
```py
print("Hello world")
```
This is the basic hello world, and anyone who thinks otherwise thought wrong. Defining `main` functions and adding `if __name__ == "main"` is not necessary and was never necessary. Python was my first language and through it I learned a lot of development concepts, it was also the language where I learned how frustrating the programming is. Python overall is a great lanuguage, the syntax is good, the standard library is amazing, and there are so many areas that one can get into with python. However, with the exception of machine learning, python always felt like it was the second best tool for the job. It was good, it could work, but it wasn't specialized (now I realize that as a scripting language, that was the intention, but it has arguably evolved to be far more than a scripting language). But with speed improvements and type compilation

**JavaScript**
```js
alert("Hello world")
```
The transition from python to JavaScript was rough. My time with JS was incredibly confusing, it lacked the solid error handling that python has (but python has arguably one of the best error handling systems, possibly second only to rust). Type conversions were (and still is) absolutely mystical to me (especially implicit type conversions). Overall, JS gave me the feeling that it was pig with lipstick on, it looks attractive on the outside, but underneath it could not quite get over the sorry muck that it used to be (JS fanboys will kill me for this, but this is my blog, not theirs). However, things are changing, TypeScript seems to be a massive step in the right direction (but the cluttered and confusing npm package ecosystem is definitely a regression).

**C++**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello world\n";
}
```
If JavaScript was a jump, then C++ was like falling off a The Grand Canyon. The syntax was deceptively simple, increasing in difficulty till the complexity became far more than I could handle. The syntax became weird and unintuitive, the concepts became extremely hard to understand. So yeah, that was my time with C++ (hint: it was not a good one). The problem with C++ is that in my opinion, it tries to maintain compatibility with C, which really limits it to how much it can change. Now, sometime in the future, I will probably regret saying this because I need some C++ features in an embedded systems project, but for now, I stand by my words.  As a little side note, adding `return 0;` is a best practice, but not necessary.

**Rust**
```rust
fn main(){
    println!("Hello world");
}
```
Rust is perhaps the second best systems programming language. I like the simplicity of the syntax, the error handling and reporting is beautiful, the guarantee of memory safety while not sacrificing on speed and resource consumption (by not using a garbage collector) is something that makes a person happy. My time with this language was excellent but I had to move on to (in my opinion), an even better language.

**C**
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
    printf("Hello world\n");
}
```
This is, in my opinion, the best language out there. 
_But it's old and smelly and it looks weird._
Yeah, but everything makes so much sense here (once you get used to the stuff that doesn't).  It comes with little to no unneeded features (\*_cough_\* OOP \*_cough_\*), and it feels minimalistic. That being said, it does have a lot of oofs, for example, strings are so weirdly handled, they are not treated as a piece of text but as an array of characters (_eeh_), a lot of the functions feel unintuitive and the naming convention is still a mystery to me. But then, I haven't been using it for too long so, maybe it just tales some getting used to.


In conclusion, there is no conclusion, this is my first blog (a "Hello, world" blog, and should hopefully not be my last.
